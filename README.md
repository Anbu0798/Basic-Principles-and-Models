# Basic Principles and Models

I have implemented basic machine learning principles and models to predict samples as Malignant or Benign within the context of cancer diagnosis. Our dataset comprises features extracted from digitized images of breast cancer cells, with each sample labeled accordingly. To ensure effective modeling, we began by preprocessing the data. This involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation. Additionally, we investigated the impact of standardizing the data, which involves transforming it to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Feature selection was also explored to identify the most relevant features for predicting the target variable, thereby improving model performance while reducing computational complexity. We implemented both the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and a Decision Tree classifier. The KNN algorithm, a non-parametric method, was employed for classification tasks, while the Decision Tree classifier partitions the feature space into regions, making predictions based on simple decision rules. Our experiments included varying the parameters, such as the number of neighbors for KNN, and evaluating model performance using accuracy and other relevant metrics. These implementations serve as fundamental building blocks for understanding more complex machine-learning techniques and their applications in real-world scenarios.
